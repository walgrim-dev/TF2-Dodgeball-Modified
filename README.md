# Commands
For a list of commands, check the configuration file located in [`addons/sourcemod/configs/dodgeball`](https://github.com/x07x08/TF2_Dodgeball_Modified/tree/main/TF2_Dodgeball_Modified/addons/sourcemod/configs/dodgeball).

# Installation
Drag and drop the contents of a folder inside the `tf` folder.

If you plan on using airblast prevention, make sure to also add the contents of [`cfg/sourcemod`](https://github.com/x07x08/TF2_Dodgeball_Modified/tree/main/TF2_Dodgeball_Modified/cfg/sourcemod).

# Requirements
- [Multi-Colors](https://github.com/Bara/Multi-Colors) (compile only).
- [More Colors](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=185016) (compile for the print plugin).

# Nuke model
By default, the plugin uses a custom model for the `"nuke"` rocket class. It can be found here : [AlliedMods Link](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showpost.php?s=8fa72450fa0c4941c927d01d2d6245c9&p=2180141&postcount=350)

# Versions
There are 2 versions : 
- The normal one : `TF2_Dodgeball_Modified`
- The "OGF" version : `TF2_Dodgeball_Modified_OGF`

The main difference between them is how the rocket moves :

- The OGF version uses [`OnGameFrame()`](https://sm.alliedmods.net/new-api/sourcemod/OnGameFrame) which is called on every single frame of the server logic (or simply put, every tick of the server's tickrate), making the rocket turn more precisely.

- The normal one uses the original method : a timer with an 0.1 seconds interval, it's less resource intensive but results in worse movement.

The OGF version also includes a few more rocket settings that are **not** present in the normal version.

**Use only one version!**
